                My name is Ashford Gavin, I was born in 2006 and have lived in Menlo Park my entire life where I am now
                a Junior at Menlo School. I first started playing soccer with AYSO when I was 5 years old, but it was
                just one of multiple sports I tried.
                Before reaching Middle School I began playing club soccer with Alpine Strikers and that is where I found
                my love for the sport.
                I spent 5 years playing with my same group of teamates and coaches. Practicing and playing games with my
                closest friends everyday created a very competative enviroment, driving me to work extra hard and helped
                me discover my passion for soccer.
                I now go to Menlo School where I have played JV and Varsity
                soccer my freshman and sophmore year, helping Menlo to become WBAL League Champs. I now also play for
                Palo Alto Soccer Club's 06 NPL team competing in NorCal NPL.
